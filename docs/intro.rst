Privox is a voice development framework. It provides solutions for integrating voice into applications. 
The public voice exchange is a user powered dynamic network which provides two standard HTTP CGI endpoints; 
one for speech to text (STT) and one for text to speech (TTS). These public APIs are anonymous, privacy
respecting services which retain no information other than that necessary to impose limits on consumption
which protect the system from overloading.

No data is saved and log files are purged hourly.

The Privox repository contains all the code used to provide the public voice exchange and anyone may use
this code to deploy their own, either public or private.

Various configurations of the software found in the repository may be used to produce edge based solutions,
embedded solutions, private voice exchanges, and cloud based services. Many examples already exist which
demonstrate basic transcription and other use cases.
