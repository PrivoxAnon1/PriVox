Nearly anyone who requires voice oriented services like speech to text (STT) or text to speech (TTS) may benefit from the public voice exchange.

It is not necessary to be a programmer, in fact the website has a page which allows you to try it out with the click of a button using standard
HTML and javascript.

Privox was designed, however, with the developer in mind. It provides STT and TTS endpoints which support standard HTTP 'post' operations 
available in nearly all programming languages. It can also be accessed from the command line using the CURL command. 

Typical applications include smart speakers, voice assistants, home automation systems, robotic control and basically anything you want to
add a voice interface to. While Privox is written in the Python programming language, it is language agnostic and the APIs adhere to
standard CGI conventions.
